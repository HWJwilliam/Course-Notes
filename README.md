Here you will find lecture notes I took for several classes I have completed in the past.

**APM 462:** Notes in Section 4 are written (very) poorly.
**MAT 354:** I would like to thank Ahmad Bajwa, Mustafa Motiwala, and Nimish Ray for their contributions. That said, approximately 90% of the content was written by me.

For academic and/or integrity reasons, **ALL** notes are released without solutions to the exercises.
